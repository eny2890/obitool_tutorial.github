# obitool_tutorial.github
This github repository is for the obitool tutorial that we will be working on in class on 9/23/24 and 9/26/24

In class on Wednesday, 9/26/24, we will be following a modified version of the obitool tutorial found here https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/ecology/tutorials/Obitools-metabarcoding/tutorial.html and here https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/obitools3/-/wikis/Wolf-tutorial-with-the-OBITools3

It is the original tutorial from OBITools from 2012, but has been modified and adjusted over time as OBItools is updated. On the trainings you will see that they have been used on various platforms (such as galaxy and jupyternotebooks), but we will use it on Hipergator using SLURM scripts.

This will teach us the basics of obitools from start to finish, since for the purposes of our project we will have to skip a few steps, given space limitiations on our hipergator account. This will also be helpful because it should be an easier version of what we are doing, so we can grasp the steps before trying it with our own, messy data.
