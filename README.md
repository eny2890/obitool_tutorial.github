# obitool_tutorial.github
This github repository is for the obitool tutorial that we will be working on in class on 9/23/24 and 9/26/24

In class, we will be following the obitool tutorial found here: https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/ecology/tutorials/Obitools-metabarcoding/tutorial.html

This will teach us the basics of obitools from start to finish, since for the purposes of our project we will have to skip a few steps, given space limitiations on our hipergator account. This will also be helpful because it should be an easier version of what we are doing, so we can grasp the steps before trying it with our own, messy data.
